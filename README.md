## Overview

I took on this challenge as a chance to strengthen my skills in Angular and Tailwind. While using a full-featured framework like Angular for a smaller project might seem like overkill, I saw it as a great opportunity to practice and reinforce core concepts. I specifically focused on integrating Angular with Tailwind, and the experience was genuinely enjoyable.

### What I learned

The core challenge in this project was using angular and tailwind CSS together. Also adding a working hamburger menu in angular way was a nice challenge.

### Continued development

Looking ahead, I plan to do more projects with Tailwind CSS for greater flexibility and modern styling. I'm also aiming to incorporate testing into my workflow and start practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) to write more reliable and maintainable code.
